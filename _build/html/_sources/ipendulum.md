### **Abstract**

The interrupted pendulum is an historical experiment, ﬁrst introduced by Galileo. It can be used to foster student participation by posing a motoric challenge and an intellectual riddle. Students are encouraged to take a more sophisticated view of the intertwining of experiment and theory. It gives an opportunity to discuss the role of idealizations in science, and the conventional nature of scientiﬁc expositions.

### **INTRODUCTION**

On the third day of the Discorsi (Two New Sciences), Galileo discusses an experiment with an interrupted pendulum. His aim is to make plausible his postulate that “the speeds acquired by one and the same body moving down planes of different inclinations are equal when the heights of these planes are equal” \[1\]. In Galileo’s pendulum (see Fig 1), the suspending wire is obstructed in mid-course by a pin. The bob, despite moving along two different arcs, still reaches the same height from which it was released. This idea makes for a nice demonstration of conservation of mechanical energy. It is as if the bob “wants” to reach its original height, and if it can’t it will twist around the obstacle. As was observed \[2\], students are intrigued by this simple experiment.  
We implemented this experiment to meet one of the biggest challenges for teachers: to make students active participants in the learning process, as opposed to mere recipients of passive or declarative knowledge. The ineffectiveness of the assertive way scientific concepts are introduced in the classroom has been pointed out many times. An educational laboratory can remediate the lack of student participation. “Perhaps the greatest advantage to be derived from a course of physical manipulation, is the means if affords of teaching a student to think for himself” says E.C. Pickering of MIT, the author of one of the first and most influential laboratory manuals published in 1873 (cited in \[3\]).  
But if, as is usually the case, the teacher sets up a conceptual framework, certain predictions as to the outcome are made, and it is left for the students to verify the theory, than we have done nothing but produce the equivalent of a lecture-style course. It is therefore desirable to design experiments which permit students to construct their own hypotheses and devise their own ways to verify them.  
Galileo’s experiment lends itself to active student participation insofar that it poses an intellectual puzzle and a motoric challenge for students, the latter motivating the formulation of a solution of the former. Furthermore, as we shall see, students can be made explicitly aware of the intertwining of inductive and hypothetico-deductive reasoning, providing an opportunity to discuss epistemology and the role of idealizations in both theory and experiments. In this note we ﬁrst discuss briefly the experiment, followed by several suggestions for discussions.

### **THE EXPERIMENT**

We adapted our standard pendulums to include a movable 6 or 3 mm diameter brass pin acting as the obstacle for the wire. If we let the lead bob go from a relatively small height, it will reach approximately the same height on the other side of the pendulum and return. If the height from which the mass is let go is large enough, the mass will go over the pin and the wire will entangle itself around the pin (Figure 1).  
We define hc and hp as respectively the critical height for which the wire just entangles itself, and the height of the pin, both relative to the reference point where the mass is at its lowest point. Our challenge for our students was: from what height must we release the bob for it to go over the pin? In other words, determine experimentally and explain theoretically the relationship between the critical height hc and the position of the pin, hp.  
We discussed two ways to proceed. One obvious way is just to do the experiment, determine hc for various hp’s, graphing the results on paper (hc vs hp ) and then try to explain the results. This was the way most groups proceeded. An alternative, we explained, is to analyze the situation, make a prediction as to what hc would be for every hp , and check the prediction experimentally. A minority of groups saw almost immediately that the mass could not rise to the same height on the other side of the pendulum if the initial height was larger than 2hp , and proceeded to check the relation hc \= 2hp . All groups grasped the task as it was laid out immediately, and proceeded to measure the height hc for which the weight landed on the pin (with a satisfying *thunk*) for a few hp’s. After only a few measurements, most groups quickly caught on to the factor 2, which now became the working hypothesis, as it was for Galileo:

Now, gentlemen, you will observe with pleasure that the ball swings to the \[same height\] in the horizontal, and you would see the same thing happen if the obstacle were placed at some lower point \[...\] the rise of the ball always terminating exactly on \[the same height\]. But when the nail is placed so low that the remainder of the thread below it will not reach \[the same height\] (which would happen if the nail were placed nearer \[the lowest point\] than to the \[height from which it was released\]) then the thread leaps over the nail and twists itself about it.

Our students are happy to have discovered this prediction, because they are able to work much faster now that they know what hc should be. Verifying the critical height is much more efficient than discovering it with many tries. With a little prodding, students can be made to articulate an “explanation” for their observations. It usually involves the above-mentioned “wanting to reach the same height” concept, which is a special form of the energy conservation principle for the case where the velocities at the two points under consideration are zero.  
But unease set in for larger values of hc and hp , which can be measured with relatively larger precision. As can be seen in Figure 2 the results for our pendulums indicate values of the critical height systematically a little bit below the expected factor two. Although students are given to explain deviations from the expectations simply with a bland affirmation of “experimental error” or, in the case of mechanical experiments, “friction”, here they are aware that they cannot give such an easy explanation, as it would lead to values of hc above the expected ones.  
As it turns out the experiment offers a surprise, which can be used to further discuss the physics of this particular situation or, more abstractly, the relation between theory and experiment. The naïve expectation that the bob must be released from at least twice the height of the pin is based upon the erroneous assumption that the trajectory of the bob after it hits the pin is a semicircle, for all velocities. In fact, the bob can never be in a position directly above the pin with zero velocity. Conservation of energy cannot be applied for this position, as was done in Ref. \[2\], if the velocity of the bob is not known.  
With the obvious idealizations (massless string, negligible pin diameter, no mechanical energy losses), the trajectory is as shown in Figure 3\. For our definition of the critical height the bob hits the pin, and the trajectory is a circle of radius hp followed by a free-fall parabola after a certain angle θc is reached.  
The centripetal force which maintains the circular trajectory is given by the tension in the wire T and the gravitational force in the radial direction mg sin θ. The angle θc after which the wire slackens and the tension is zero can be found considering that at that angle ![][image1] and that the velocity vc at this point is given by energy conservation: ![][image2]. Some algebra shows that  
![][image3]  
After this point and at larger angles, the trajectory is a parabola. For the trajectory to move through the origin we can show (by simulation or by simple but rather elaborate algebraic manipulations) that hc \= 1.866hp which is 7% less than the original (and Galileo’s) prediction hc \= 2hp.  
Off course, energy losses in flight or when the wire hits the pin will elevate the necessary height again. Two corrections to our naïve model act in opposite directions, which complicates but also makes the situation more realistic.  
Our pendulums are 1.5 m long, with a 1 cm diameter lead spherical bob and a 3 or 6 mm diameter brass blocking pin. With this setup we can determine and reproduce measurements of hc to within less than a centimeter. The results (Figure 2\) can be described by a best fit of hc \= (1.96 ± 0.01)hp − 1.1 cm. Our students certainly noted that their results lay systematically below their expectations. But without exception they thought they must have done something wrong. This lack of confidence in their own data indicates the need for their teachers to explain clearly the role of idealized models in a real world.

### **SUGESTIONS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION**

The experiment was successful in demonstrating for students the tension between inductive and deductive reasoning. They could be made aware of the psychological pressures to “get the right result”, and the way in which this pressure can influence their measurements. We also discussed the conventional nature of the usual lab report, which mirrors the hypothetico-deductive based format of scientific presentations in the physical sciences: theory and expectations first, data en discussions last. This is also the format usually recommended for a lab report. But, as the students have just seen, this is not necessarily the actual sequence of events; hypotheses may be suggested by or even adjusted to experimental data. The usual mode of discourse of professional scientists is just a convention. The complicated intertwining of adjusted hypotheses with data taking based on expectations is not (and arguably should not) represented in these reports. But students must be made aware that in reality, there must be as many ways of doing science as there are scientists.  
It can be noted that in the biological sciences an inductive format – supposedly unbiased results, followed by a discussion – is conventionally used. In this context it may be worthwhile to mention the criticism of Peter Medawar \[4\] concerning the presentation of scientific results in his famous article “is the scientific article a fraud?”  
As a further point of discussion, it may be worth recalling the role of experiments at the dawn of modern science, in particular its role for Galileo. It would be a mistake to assume that Galileo actually did all of the experiments he describes. Dijksterhuis \[5\] sums up the view of historians of science in the 1950s: “In the practice of his work \[experiments\] are felt as somewhat superfluous, if the reasoning seems very convincing” and he cites Galileo’s letter to Ingoli: “I did an experiment, but even before that reason (il natural discorso) had already convinced me that the phenomenon should occur as it indeed occurred”. Lest we give the wrong impression of a completely “platonic” Galileo, it should be emphasized that later historians of science, especially Stillman Drake, using recently discovered notebooks, showed that Galileo certainly was a scrupulous experimenter.  
It could be argued that this (kind of) experiment “fills a much needed gap” in that the methods of physics are best taught by osmosis as opposed to explicitly in a formal class, since there are many ways of doing physics anyway. On this view, we would best stick to presenting and demonstrating only the real content of physics, leaving the methods and ethics to be acquired during apprenticeship in a real research laboratory. Nevertheless, we believe that although benign fictions and idealizations about the scientific method have their place in the curriculum, we should also expound the myriad ways in which science and scientists proceed. An experiment from the history of physics is an especially apt device to do so.
